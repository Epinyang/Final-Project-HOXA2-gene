INTRO
Homeobox genes are found in groups A, B, C, and D on separate chromosomes. The HOXA2 (Homeobox A2), which is part of group A and located on chromosome 7, gene is known to regulate gene expression, morphogenesis, and differentiation. It is also involved in placing hindbrain segments in the proper location along the anterior-posterior axis during embryonic development. My biological question will show which animals have the gene HOXA2 and their relation to Mus musculus (house mouse).
